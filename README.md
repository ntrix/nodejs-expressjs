# Library App

## Project

On the front-end,

-  Edit `views/index.html` to change the content of the webpage
-  `public/client.js` is the javacript that runs when you load the webpage
-  `public/style.css` is the styles for `views/index.html`
-  Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,

-  your app starts at `server.js`
-  add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
-  safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
